                            ### The Basics ###

## Literals ##

    A literal is any notation that lets you represent a fixed value in source
    code. For instance, all of the following are literals in Ruby:

        'Hello, world!'          # string literal
        375                      # integer literal
        3.141528                 # float literal
        true                     # boolean literal
        { 'a' => 1, 'b' => 2 }   # hash literal
        [ 1, 2, 3 ]              # array literal
        :sym                     # symbol literal
        nil                      # nil literal

    We will meet these literals and others soon.

## Strings ##

    A string is a list of characters in a specific sequence. In programming,
    we often have to work with text data like names, messages, and descriptions.
    Ruby uses strings to represent such data. You write string literals with
    either single quotes ('hi there') or double quotes ("hi there") on either
    side of the text; note that the quotes are syntactic components, not part
    of the value. Both single and double quote formats create a string.
    However, there are some subtle differences.

    If you'd like to include single quotes within your string then you have two
    options. You can either use the double quote method or the single quote
    method with escaping:

        # with double quotes
        "The man said, 'Hi there!'"

        # with single quotes and escaping
        'The man said, \'Hi there'\''

    The backslash, or escape (\) character, tells the computer that the quotes
    that follow it are not meant as Ruby syntax but only as simple quote
    characters to be included in the string.

    Double quotes allow something called "string interpolation". To try it out, 
    type the following into an irb session:

        irb :001 > a = 'ten'
        => "ten"

        irb :002 > "My favorite number is #{a}!"
        => "My favorite number is ten!"

    String interpolation is a handy way to merge Ruby code with strings.
    The basic syntax is: #{ruby expression goes here}, and the returned
    expression will be concatenated with the surrounding string.
    String interpolation only works within double quotes. You'll get quite
    familiar with this technique over time.

## Symbols ##

    Ruby symbols are created by placing a colon (:) before a word.

        # Examples of symbols
        :name
        :a_symbol
        :"surprisingly, this is also a symbol"

    Symbols don't have to be valid variable names if the symbol is enclosed
    in quotes, as the last example above demonstrates.

    Basically, a symbol is used when you want to reference something like a
    string but don't ever intend to print it to the screen or change it.
    It is often referred to as an immutable (i.e. unchangeable) string.
    Whilst not 100% technically correct, it is a useful mnemonic device
    for now.

## Numbers ##

    Numbers are represented many ways in Ruby. The most basic form of a number
    is called an integer. It is represented by the whole number only , with
    no decimal point. A more complex form of a number is called a float.
    A float is a number that contains a decimal.

        # Example of integer literals
        1, 2, 3, 50, 10, 4345098098

        # Example of float literals
        1.2345, 2345.4267, 98.2234

## nil ##

    In programming, we need a way to express "nothing", and in Ruby, we do this
    through something called nil. A variable with a value of nil could be
    described as having "nothing" nor being "completely empty", or even just
    simple "not any specific type". A situation where this may occur is where
    output is expected but none is returned, such as:

        irb :001 > puts "Hello, World!"
        Hello, World!
        => nil

    The puts method prints out a string and returns nothing, so we see nil
    being returned after the string is displayed.

    You can explicitly refer to the nil value by using the nil literal in
    our code:

        irb :002 > x = nil            # nil literal used here
        => nil

    It is possible to check if something is a nil type by using .nil?.
    For example:

        "Hello, World".nil?
        => false

    An important property of the nil type is that when used in an expression,
    such as an if statement, it will be treated as false, as it represents an
    absence of content.

        irb :001 > if nil
        irb :002 > puts "Hello, World!"
        irb :003 > end
        => nil

    In the above example, the return value (as shown by the hash rocket =>) is
    nil, and the code contained within the if is not run, as nil is interpreted
    as being a false condition. If instead you were to do the following:

        irb :001 > if 1
        irb :002 > puts "Hello, World!"
        irb :003 > end
        Hello, World!
        => nil

    Since 1 is not "nothing" or a false value, the code within the if is run
    and we see the output. We'll talk more about conditionals and if
    statements later, but just remember that nil can be used within a
    conditional statement, and it will be treated as false.

    There's an important caveat to this which can be best illustrated by the
    following example:

        false == nil
        => false
    
    Whilst both false and nil are treated as negative when evaluated in
    an expression, they are not equivalent, as demonstrated by the above.

## Operations ##

# Adding, Subtracting, and Multiplying Integers #

    Basic mathematical operations in Ruby are quite simple. To add two integers
    together just use the + operator as shown below in irb. Make sure to
    type these example into irb and feel free to play with other integers
    as well.

        1 + 1
        => 2

    Subtraction works the same way.

        1 - 1
        => 0

    To multiply, use the * operator.

        4 * 4
        => 16

# Division vs. Modulo #

    You can divide integers with the / operator.

        16 / 4
        => 4

    There is also an operator called the modulo operator. This is represented
    by the % symbol. It can be referred to as the remainder operator as well,
    though that is not strictly correct. (There are some subtle differences
    between modulo and remainder operations). In modulo expressions,
    the value to the left of the % is call the dividend, and the value to
    the right is called the modulus.

    When working with positive integers, the modulo operator returns the
    remainder of a division operation. Let's test this.

        16 % 4
        => 0

    That's not very interesting. What about this?

        16 % 5
        => 1

    There we go! Since 16 divided by 5 equals 3 with a remainder of 1, the
    1 is what we get returned.

    Now, notice what happens when I try to divide the integers that don't
    divide evenly.

        15 / 4
        => 3

    When dividing integers, you will only receive an integer in return.
    We need a different data type if we want more precision. That's where
    floats come in, which we'll get to in a moment. First, though, we need
    to talk about something that sometimes ends up confusing students: the
    difference between modulo and remainder.

# Modulo vs. Remainder #

    The #remainder method computes and returns the remainder of an integer
    division operation:

        16.remainder(5)
        => 1

    Hmm... that's exattly the same result as 16 % 5. However, you can't count
    on that always being true, as we'll see momentarily.

    There is also a #divmod method that computes both the integer result
    of the division and its modulo value.

        16.divmod(5)
        => [3, 1]

    In mathematics, there is a subtle, but important difference between modulo
    and remainder operations. We won't get into the mathematical definitions,
    but the effect can be summarised as follows:

         - Modulo operations return a positive integer when the second
         operand is positive, and a negative integer when the second
         operand is negative.

         - Remainder operations return a positive integer when the first
         operand is positive, and a negative integer when the first operand
         is negative.

    We can see this definition at work in this table:

        a 	b 	a % b (modulo) 	a.remainder(b) 	a.divmod(b)
        17 	5 	    2 	             2 	          [3, 2]
        17 -5 	   -3 	             2 	          [-4, -3]
       -17 	5 	    3 	            -2 	          [-4, 3]
       -17 -5 	   -2 	            -2 	          [3, -2]

    When working with positive integers, we don't need to worry whether we
    should use the modulo operator or the remainder method; the return
    value is positive and identical either way. However, if either number
    is negative, that's where things get confusing. It really isn't easy to
    keep the above rules in mind, especially when you don't encounter them
    often. To complicate matters even more, some languages use the % operator
    to compute the remainder instead of the modulo value.

    In general, you want to avoid this problem -- if you need to determine
    the modulo or remainder of two integers, try to work with positive
    integers exclusively. If you can't, then make sure you know exactly which
    operator or method you need to use when working with negative integers.

# Multiplying and Dividing Floats #

    In order to get a more accurate calculation of the above divisoin problem,
    we can use floats.

        15.0 / 4
        => 3.75

    Ah, that looks better. Whenever you use a float in an operation, Ruby
    always returns a float, even if one of the numbers is a plain integer.

    You can also multiply floats to do more complex multiplication.

    9.75 * 4.32
    => 42.120000000000005

# Equality Comparison #

    There are times when you want to check if the values of two objects are
    the same. To test the equality of two things you can use the == operator
    (read == as "is equal to" or, sometimes as "equal equal"). This compares
    the object on the left of the == with the object on the right and returns
    either true or false. true and false are called boolean values in most
    programming languages. Let's try some comparisons out in irb.
    Don't forget to type these examples out as well!

        4 == 4
        => true

    You can use the == operator with strings as well.

        "foo" == "foo"
        => true

        "foo" == "bar"
        => false

    What happens when you type the following command in irb?

        "4" == 4
        => false

    The comparison returns false because we are comparing two different types.

    Because "4" is a string and 4 is an integer, the == operator returns false.

# String Concatenation #

    String concatenation looks a lot like addition. When you use the + operator
    to join two strings together, you are performing a string concatenation.
    Back to irb!

        "foo" + "foo"
        => "foofoo"

        "foo" + "bar"
        => "foobar"

    It's pretty simple, but feel free to play around with this functionality to
    get a better feel for it.

    Let's try something a little different. What will the following return?
    Try it yourself.

        "1" + "1"
        => "11"

    It makes 11 and not 2 because they are both strings, not numbers. The strings
    are concatenated, not added (if they were numbers).

    What happens if we try to concatenate a string with a number?

        "one" + 1
        => TypeError: no implicit conversion of Integer into String
            from (irb):1:in `+'
            from (irb):1
            from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

    Looks like we have an error message! The interpreter is complaining that it
    can't implicitly convert an integer into a string. What does that mean?
    In this case, it looks like we cannot add an integer and string together.

## Type Conversion ##

    But what if we need to add a String and an Integer together? Suppose we got
    some user input of "12", which is a String, but we want to increment this
    by 2. We know that we can't just do "12" + 2 as we'll get an error.

    There's a handy method that we can call which will convert a String to
    an Integer, and it's called to_i. You can call it on any String like this:

        "12".to_i
        => 12

    You can see that this returns an Integer. Okay, we've used some new words
    like method and returns. These are really important to understand. For now,
    just know that we can call to_i on strings and then we can perform integer
    operations, like adding and subtracting, on the result.

    Play with to_i in irb on some strings and see what you get. You may be
    surprised by the results. There are also other useful conversion operators,
    like to_f, that you may be interested in testing out as well.

    Below are some examples to try:

        irb :001 > '4'.to_i
        => 4

        irb :002 > '4 hi there'.to_i
        => 4

        irb :003 > 'hi there 4'.to_i
        => 0

        irb :004 > '4'.to_f
        => 4.0

        irb :005 > '4 hi there'.to_f
        => 4.0

        irb :006 > 'hi there 4'.to_f
        => 0.0

    And if you guessed that there's a similar to_s method to convert integers
    and floats into string, you would be right. (I WAS YAY!).

    Tried this when experimenting:

        12390123.4439024.to_s
        => "12390123.4439024"

    This is just scratching the surface of Ruby's built-in conversion methods,
    but it's good enough for now. Just know that there's probably a way to
    convert from one basic type to another, though there may be some side
    effects when you do the conversion. Always play around with it in irb to
    get a feel for the edge cases.

## Basic Data Structures ##

    Two very common data structures that you will use as a Ruby programmer
    are arrays and hashes. They will be covered in more depth later, but we
    wanted to give you a taste of them early on for a smoother learning curve.

# Arrays #

    An array is used to organise information into an ordered list. The list
    can be made up of strings, integers, floats, booleans or any other data type.
    In Ruby, an array literal is denoted by square brackets []. Inside the
    brackets you can create a list of elements separated by commas. Let's make
    one in irb.

     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    We've created an array of integers 1 through 5. Each element in an array
    can be accessed via an index. the indexes are numbered starting at zero.
    Thus, if we wanted only the first element in the array we could do this.

        [1, 2, 3, 4, 5][0]
        => 1

    Don't worry if the [0] part through you off. We will cover arrays in much
    more detail later. This is just meant to show you that the first element,
    the number 1, is located in the 0 index of the array. Play around with the
    syntax above by swapping the value of 0 for another index. The key thing
    to remember about an array is that order is important, and elements
    within an array can be retrieved by their index, which starts at 0.

# Hashes #

    A hash, sometimes referred to as a dictionary, is a set of key-value pairs.
    Hash literals are represented with the curly brackets {}. A key-value pair
    is an association where a key is assigned a specific value. A hash consists
    of a key, usually represented by a symbol, that points to a value (denoted
    using a => ) of any type of data. Let's make some hashes to get the feeling
    of it.

        {:dog => "barks"}
        => {:dog => "barks"}

    The above is a hash literal that specifies a single key-value pair.
    Like arrays, we can have multiple items in a hash if we separate them
    with commas, but they will not necessarily be in any specific order.
    Let's add some more items to our hash.

        {:dog => "barks", :cat => "meows", :pig => "oinks"}
        => {:dog=>"barks", :cat=>"meows", :pig=>"oinks"}

    What if we wanted to find out what noise a cat makes? We can retrieve a
    value by its key:

        {:dog => "barks", :cat => "meows", :pig => "oinks"}
        => "meows"

    Once again, right now it's only important that you understand these basic
    data structures. They are the building blocks of programming and you'll
    be exploring these for a long time as you grow as a Ruby developer.
    The most important thing to remember about hashes is that you use keys
    to set or retrieve values. Let's move on for now and we'll visit these
    concepts again later on.

## Expressions and Return ##

    You may have noticed, indirectly at this point, that every time you enter
    something into irb you see the => back, which is called a hash rocket
    (cool name, huh?), followed by whatever your Ruby expression returns.
    When you type something in at the irb prompt, you are creating an
    expression. An expression is anything that can be evaluated, and pretty
    much everything you write in Ruby is an expression. An expression in Ruby
    always returns something, even if that's an error message or nil.
    We'll talk in more depth about return as we move on, but remember
    that Ruby expressions always return a value, even if that value is nil
    or an error.

## puts vs return ##

    It's common for new Ruby programmers with little experience to become
    confused with the difference between puts and return. The confusion
    arises from a misundestanding of what both puts and return are.
    When we call the puts method, we're telling Ruby to print something to
    the screen. However, puts does not return what is printed to the screen.
    Expressions do something, but they also return something. The value
    returned is not necessarily the action that was performed. Let's take
    a look in irb.

        puts "stuff"
        stuff
        => nil

    You can see that the word stuff was printed to the console and then a nil,
    which is Ruby's way of saying "nothing", was returned. It's important to
    understand that distinction. For example:

        a = puts "stuff"
        puts a

    What should we expect? a is assigned to the value return by puts "stuff,
    which is nil. Therefore, puts a results in "nil" being printed out.
    We are going to go much further into puts and return later when we talk
    about methods, but we had to show you puts because we are going to be using
    it in future examples.

## Summary ##

    This chapter covered the basic building blocks of the Ruby language.
    You learned some basic data types and how to combine those types
    with operators. You also learned about data structures and how to use
    those structures to hold and access data. We'll dive much deeper into
    these in the coming chapters, but for now, let's "learn through our fingers"
    and do some exercises to deepen our understanding of the basics.

## Exercises ##

    Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first
    and last name as your full name in one string.

    "<Firstname> <Lastname>"

    For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put
    "John" and "Doe" together to get "John Doe".

    My answer:

        first_name = "Cyber"
        last_name = "Racc"

        first_name + last_name

    Could also simply do: "Cyber" + "Racc", if it were an actual name you
    could add a space after "Cyber", like "Cyber " + "Racc" for "Cyber Racc".

# Exercise 2 #

    Use the modulo operator, division, or a combination of
    both to take a 4 digit number and find the digit in the:
    1) thousands place 2) hundreds place 3) tens place 4) ones place

    Solution:

        thousands = 4936 / 1000
        hundreds = 4936 % 1000 / 100
        tens = 4936 % 1000 % 100 / 10
        ones = 4936 % 1000 % 100 % 10

        Note that for the tens and ones, you can skip the extra % operations
        like this:

        tens = 4936 % 100 / 10
        ones = 4936 % 10

# Exercise 3 #

    Write a program that uses a hash to store a list of movie titles
    with the year they came out. Then use the puts command to make your
    program print out the year of each movie to the screen. The output
    for your program should look something like this:

        1975
        2004
        2013
        2001
        1981

    My answer:

        movies = {  :"Ready Player One" => 2018,
                    :"Avatar" => 2009,
                    :"Tron: Legacy" => 2010 }

        puts movies[:"Ready Player One"]
        puts movies[:"Avatar"]
        puts movies[:"Tron: Legacy"]

# Exercise 4 #

    Use the dates from the previous example and store them in an array.
    Then make your program output the same thing as exercise 3.

    My answer:

        dates = [1975, 2004, 2013, 2001, 1981]

        puts dates[0]
        puts dates[1]
        puts dates[2]
        puts dates[3]
        puts dates[4]

# Exercise 5 #

    Write a program that outputs the factorial of the numbers 5, 6, 7 and 8.

    Solution:

        puts 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
        puts 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
        puts 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
        puts 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

# Exercise 6 #

    Write a program that calculates the squares of 3 float numbers of
    your choosing and outputs the result to the screen.

    Solution:

        puts 4.30 * 4.30
        puts 6.13 * 6.13
        puts 124.34 * 124.34

# Exercise 7 #

    What does the following error message tell you?

        SyntaxError: (irb):2: syntax error, unexpected ')', expecting '}'
        from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

    My answer:

        It means the coder has used a bracket instead of a curly bracket.

    Solution:

        There is an opening bracket somewhere in the program without a
        closing bracket following it. It may have happened when
        creating a hash.
