    What is a variable?

        A variable is a container that is used to store information that is referenced and
        manipulated by a computer. They provide a way to label data with a descriptive name.

    How do you assign a value or an expression to a variable?

        With the = symbol, for example:

            age = 24;

    What does the += assignment operator do?

        Adds and assigns the result back to the variable. For example:

            age = 24

            age += 6
            => 30

        Age now has a value of 30.

    What does the -= assignment operator do?

        Same as above but for subtraction.

        age -= 6
        => 24

    What does the *= assignment operator do?

        Same as above but for multiplication

            age *= 2
            => 48

    What does the /= assignment operator do?

        Same as above but for divide:

            age /= 2
            => 24

    What are the variable naming conventions?

        Local variables are always lowercase and snake_case.
        
            new_variable = "something"

        constant variables are always uppercase and snake_case.

            NEW_CONSTANT = "idk"

        global variables start with a $

            $new_global_variable = "summit"

        class variables start with two @ symbols

            @@new_class_variable = "idek though"

        instance variables start with a single @ symbol

            @new_instance_variable = "something again"
