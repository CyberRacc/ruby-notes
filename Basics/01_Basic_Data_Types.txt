### Basic Data Types ###

    Ruby is a strongly object-oriented language, which means that absolutely
    everything in Ruby is an object, even the most basic data types.

    Here are four of Ruby's basic data types:

        numbers (integers and floats)

        strings

        symbols

        Booleans (true, false, and nil).

## Numbers ##

    Ruby has all the typical math operators you would expect:

       # Addition
        1 + 1   #=> 2

        # Subtraction
        2 - 1   #=> 1

        # Multiplication
        2 * 2   #=> 4

        # Division
        10 / 5  #=> 2

        # Exponent
        2 ** 2  #=> 4
        3 ** 4  #=> 81

        # Modulus (find the remainder of division)
        8 % 2   #=> 0  (8 / 2 = 4; no remainder)
        10 % 4  #=> 2  (10 / 4 = 2 with a remainder of 2)

# Integers and Floats #

    There are two main types of numbers in Ruby. Integers are whole numbers,
    such as 10. Floats are numbers that contain a decimal point, such as 10.5,
    10.0, or 0.25.

    It's important to keep in mind that when doing arithmetic with two integers
    in Ruby, the result will always be an integer.

        17 / 5 #=> 3, not 3.4

    To obtain an accurate answer, just replace one of the integers in the
    expression with a float.

        17 / 5.0 #=> 3.4

# Converting Number Types #

    Ruby makes it very easy to convert floats to integers and vice versa.

        # To convert an integer to a float:
        13.to_f #=> 13.0

        # To convert a float to an integer:
        13.0.to_i #=> 13
        13.9.to_i #=> 13

    As shown in the last example above, when Ruby converts a float to an integer,
    the decimal places are simply cut off. Ruby doesn't do any rounding in this
    conversion.

# Some Useful Number Methods #

    There are many useful methods for numbers built into Ruby. For example,

    #even?

        6.even? #=> true
        7.even? #=> false

    #odd?

        6.odd? #=> false
        7.odd? #=> true

## Strings ##

    At first glace, you might think strings are just a bunch of characters
    that aren't very useful beyond getting user input and outputting some
    information to the screen, but that's not true at all.

# Double and Single Quotation Marks #
